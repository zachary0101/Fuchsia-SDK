/// Visibility state of a Story within the session shell.
/// This state describes how a story should be displayed within the session shell,
/// regardless of whether the story is in focus or not. Focus state and
/// visibility state are orthogonal concepts.
/// E.g A story can be out-of-focus and be in IMMERSIVE state at the same time
/// if a user was playing a video, exits, then re-enters the story. The
/// expectation in this scenario is that the story is in IMMERSIVE state upon
/// re-enter.
///
/// All state transitions are possible.
